# Salon Management System

This project is a salon management system that allows users to schedule appointments for different services.

## Project Description

The salon management system fulfills the following user stories:

- **User Story #1**: There should be a database named "salon" created.
- **User Story #2**: Tables named "customers", "appointments", and "services" should be created in the "salon" database.
- **User Story #3**: Each table should have a primary key column that automatically increments, following the naming convention "table_name_id".
- **User Story #4**: The "appointments" table should have a "customer_id" foreign key that references the "customer_id" column from the "customers" table.
- **User Story #5**: The "appointments" table should have a "service_id" foreign key that references the "service_id" column from the "services" table.
- **User Story #6**: The "customers" table should have a "phone" column that is a VARCHAR and must be unique.
- **User Story #7**: The "customers" and "services" tables should have a "name" column.
- **User Story #8**: The "appointments" table should have a "time" column that is a VARCHAR.
- **User Story #9**: There should be at least three rows in the "services" table for the different services offered, one with a "service_id" of 1.
- **User Story #10**: A script file named "salon.sh" should be created in the project folder.
- **User Story #11**: The script file should have executable permissions.
- **User Story #12**: The script should display a numbered list of the services offered before the first prompt for input.
- **User Story #13**: If an invalid service_id is entered, the script should display the list of services again.
- **User Story #14**: The script should prompt users to enter a service_id, phone number, name if they aren't already a customer, and a time.
- **User Story #15**: If a phone number entered doesnâ€™t exist, the script should prompt for the customer's name and insert both phone number and name into the customers table.
- **User Story #16**: If the phone number already exists, the script should directly prompt for the service_id and time.
- **User Story #17**: After an appointment is successfully added, the script should output a message confirming the appointment details.
